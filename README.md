# My MacBook - How I set it up

I worked 23 years with linux - and I liked it. 

"I love the command line more than any graphic interface. I want to type commands, not move graphics around on a screen. Working through my keyboard is faster than clicking for me, and what I do seems more real. I don't know what it is that makes the keyboard seem more real than icons in a window. They're both abstractions, different ways of interacting with a a flow of bits and bytes. Maybe I was brainwashed from my early exposure to Unix." (Stephen Figgins)

Now I work for a new company ([Staffbase](https://staffbase.com/)) and most people use a Mac. I don't want to swim against the stream. 

I need to taggle some issues to feel comfortable. You find my solutions in this README. Feedback is welcome.
